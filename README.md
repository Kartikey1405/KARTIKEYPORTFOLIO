# Cosmic Portfolio — Full Stack Personal Website

## About the Developer

I am a Full Stack Developer proficient in Java and the Spring ecosystem, with a strong focus on building robust backend systems. My expertise extends to frontend development using React, allowing me to create end-to-end web solutions. I also have a keen interest in Machine Learning and integrating AI models into web applications.

This portfolio serves as a demonstration of my technical abilities, bridging complex server-side logic with immersive, interactive user interfaces.

## Portfolio Theme

The website is built around a "Cosmic / Futuristic" design philosophy. It moves away from traditional static layouts, utilizing physics-based animations and spatial concepts to present information.

- Visual Style: High-contrast neon aesthetics (Cyan, Gold, Purple) against deep space backgrounds  
- Desktop Experience: Features 3D orbital mechanics, interactive star maps, and holographic carousels  
- Mobile Experience: Utilizes a Hybrid Responsive Strategy, switching complex 3D animations to optimized, high-performance vertical grids and lists for touch devices

## Key Features

- Orbital Navigation:  
  A dynamic navigation bar that adapts based on the device, featuring a spotlight effect on desktop and a slide-out drawer on mobile.

- Solar System Projects:  
  On desktop, projects orbit a central core like planets. On mobile, they transform into a clean, vertical Mission Log.

- Tech Constellation:  
  An interactive star map connecting technologies based on their relationships (for example, connecting Java to Spring Boot).

- Holographic Certificates:  
  A 3D perspective carousel displaying achievements and research papers.

- Backend-Integrated Contact:  
  A fully functional contact form that communicates with a Spring Boot backend.

- Email System:  
  Integrated SendGrid Web API for reliable, secure email delivery, bypassing standard SMTP port restrictions.

- Keep-Alive Architecture:  
  Implemented self-ping scheduling to prevent the backend service from entering sleep mode on cloud hosting tiers.
